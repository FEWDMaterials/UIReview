## [clicking on one box changes color of another](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/UIReview/tree/master/p3)

Given two boxes, clicking on one updates the background color of the other.

### Stretch Goals

1. Given the other box, clicking on it updates the bgColor of the first box.
2. Add in a conditional so that *if* either box has it's bgColor set (ie: not white), then clicking on it does nothing.
