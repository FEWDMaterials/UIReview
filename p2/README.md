# [Remove typed vowels from message](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/UIReview/tree/master/p2)

As the user types, detect if the keypress is a vowel. If it is, tell the user s/he typed in a vowel and which one it it.

### Stretch Goals

1. Do not allow the pressed vowel to show up in the input field.
